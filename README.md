# Relationship between reward-related brain activity and opportunities to sit

This repository contains `R` scripts to analyze reward associated with sitting down or squatting while undergoing electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. 

## Data for analyses in R
The data used in the R script is available in CSV format in the "Data_R_models" directory.

## Raw behavioral data
The raw behavioral data for each participant is available in the "Data" directory.

## EEG

EEG processing history files are available at: https://auburn.box.com/s/mqbfhk0tbamj2hyq4oh3wxropeh8an3u  
EEG exported data files are available at: https://auburn.box.com/s/2au12315j4ympdlbbay9cwg99jmnh4bh
